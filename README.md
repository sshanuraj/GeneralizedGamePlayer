# GeneralizedGamePlayer

A generalized game playing agent for simple zero-sum games. 

It can learn any game which has a n-in-a-row winnning condition, where you can define the board parameters and n.

This agent will start learning the game and then most probably start beating you in these games.

The most common games would be Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect-4 or Gomoku!
